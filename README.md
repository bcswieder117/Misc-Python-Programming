# Misc-Python-Programming
In this repository, I am showing my ability to code in Python. This repository is in progress. These are indeed simple programs now, but I plan on increasing complexity to include Python projects in here. 

With the LeetCode files, I will be developing a separate repository for these when I am confident of my skills. This is a learning repository, and not necessarily stating that I am perfect in those problems by any means. However, hopefully will teach me the concepts I was never taught in a formal academic course as I specialized in Mathematics and Foreign Languages in undergraduate at Tennessee Technological University.
